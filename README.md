# Powershell Scripts

## Running the scripts
These steps must be followed to have your machine run the scripts in this repository.

### Configure the scripts
Currently the scripts are adapted to my machines paths. These should reflect your machines paths to function.

### Set-ExecutionPolicy
By default, powershell does not allow all scripts to be run in it. The execution policy should be set to RemoteSigned.

### Running powershell scripts in the Windows Terminal
When the above steps have been followed you can run the script in powershell. This is done with the `./<script-name>` command.
